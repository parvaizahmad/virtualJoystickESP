# virtualJoystickESP

This project provides a virtual joystick implementation for ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. 
The virtual joystick allows for remote control of devices using a web interface, making it ideal for IoT applications. 
It supports both ESP32 and ESP8266 platforms, offering flexibility and ease of integration into various projects.

I am not a professional web developer. If anyone wants to contribute and improve this joystick or add support for more controllers, they are welcome and should contribute to the project.
